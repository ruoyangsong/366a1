I put the code to create a plot in the wind_exp, so plot can be created after you run
python wind_exp in the terminal.

To decide the 9th action is used or not, change the array called action is sarsa_agent.py.

I did not include rl_glue in the zip file, please import rl_glue.py and utils.py to run my program.
